		<p>Hi, I'm Dev.</p>
		
		<p>I'm a November 2022 graduate of <a target="_blank" href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>. I was a <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/king-scholars/">King Scholar</a> and studied Geography and Geospatial Statistics. I use my qualitative and quantitative skillset to explore my research interests in political eco(nomy/logy), global macroeconomic governance, climate change &amp; mitigation, and the linkages between the modern state, capital mobility, and the climate crisis.</p>

		<p>I have experience working with public opinion, governmental, epidemiological, and geospatial data. One of my projects was a look into the statistical biases common in analyses of COVID-19 data in US prisons, wherein I modified recent econometric approaches to apply to prison epidemiology. Another project dealt with charting the public response to COVID-19, both as lifestyle choices and as emotional state.</p>

		<p>I've also worked on projects mapping good places to eat in New Delhi and calculating the annual carbon emissions of Chinese coal plants, as well as developing experimental game theory approaches to determine population-level strategies for resource-extraction games. My most recent project used a multi-level model to estimate the impact of being located in high-disaster-risk counties on the personal climate risk-perception of people with different political orientations.</p>

		<p>In my qualitative work, my earlier projects have been a comparative literature analysis of internet "memes" as (meta-)linguistic texts, as well as a preliminary social theory of power in modern India. My senior-year independent study looked at climate policy briefs and philosophical accounts of time-perception to develop a roadmap for planetary climate action based on how people perceive future risks.</p>

		<p>At Dartmouth, I have interned for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustainability.dartmouth.edu/">Sustainability Office</a>, served on the advisory board of the <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/fysep/about/about-fysep">First-Generation Student Program (FYSEP)</a>, and been an elected executive of the <a target="_blank" href="https://engage.dartmouth.edu/organization/international-students-association">International Student Association</a>. I also successfully advocated for divesting the Dartmouth endowment from fossil fuel corporations with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2019/05/divest-dartmouth-re-focuses-strategy-after-period-of-low-visibility">Divest Dartmouth</a>. I also spent more than a year organizing with the mutual aid efforts of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/01/dartmouth-student-union-raises-over-50000-in-mutual-aid">Dartmouth Student Union</a> to help Dartmouth students through the economic hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

		<p>Iâ€™m currently taking a short break before starting post-graduate work, working my way through climate mitigation literature and trying to get better at French.</p>
