		<p>Hi, I'm Dev. <a href="#" onclick="playSound('audio/dev.mp3');"><i class="material-icons">volume_up</i></a></p>
		
		<p>I'm a <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/king-scholars/">King Scholar</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>, majoring in Geography and using the tools of the discipline to explore my research interests in political eco(nomy/logy), global macroeconomic governance, the social impact of transnational migration, and the theoretical relationship between the modern state, inequality, and crisis.</p>

		<p>All these interests come together in my current project analyzing the impacts of climate change on migration to Europe. I’m drawing upon historical scholarship on European governance & trade and using empirical inputs from state-level population data & Geographic Information Systems (GIS) models. Situating all of this in a framework drawing upon critical social theory & psychoanalysis, my planned final product is a comparative study of the geographies of climate migration across Europe, and the implications this has for pan- and intra-European politics.</p>

		<p>At Dartmouth, I have interned for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustainability.dartmouth.edu/">Sustainability Office</a>, served on the advisory board of the <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/fysep/about/about-fysep">First-Generation Student Program (FYSEP)</a>, and been an elected executive of the <a target="_blank" href="https://engage.dartmouth.edu/organization/international-students-association">International Student Association</a>. I have also advocated for divesting the Dartmouth endowment from fossil fuel corporations with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2019/05/divest-dartmouth-re-focuses-strategy-after-period-of-low-visibility">Divest Dartmouth</a>. In 2020, I was a <a target="_blank" href="https://divested.betterfutureproject.org/">DivestEd</a> organizing fellow, and I trained with 20+ university-level fossil fuel divestment campaigns across the United States. I am presently organizing with the mutual aid efforts of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/01/dartmouth-student-union-raises-over-50000-in-mutual-aid">Dartmouth Student Union</a> to help Dartmouth students through the economic hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

		<p>I’m currently on a gap year, tinkering with European migration datasets in Python, learning how to speak French, and working my way through an economic history reading list.</p>
