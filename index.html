		<p>Hi, I'm Dev.</p>
		
		<p>I'm a <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/king-scholars/">King Scholar</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>, majoring in Geography and Quantitative Social Science. I use my qualitative and quantitative skillset to explore my research interests in Internet-based communications, political eco(nomy/logy), global macroeconomic governance, transnational migration, and the linkages between the modern state, inequality, and crisis.</p>

		<p>I have experience working with public opinion, governmental, and geospatial data. I've worked on projects charting the public response to COVID-19, mapping good places to eat in New Delhi, and calculating the annual carbon emissions of Chinese coal plants. I'm also trained in hermeneutics and ethnography, and am currently part of a public humanities project looking at Internet-transmitted images ("memes") as a cross-cultural, cross-linguistic phenomenon.</p>

		<p>At Dartmouth, I have interned for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustainability.dartmouth.edu/">Sustainability Office</a>, served on the advisory board of the <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/fysep/about/about-fysep">First-Generation Student Program (FYSEP)</a>, and been an elected executive of the <a target="_blank" href="https://engage.dartmouth.edu/organization/international-students-association">International Student Association</a>. I also successfully advocated for divesting the Dartmouth endowment from fossil fuel corporations with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2019/05/divest-dartmouth-re-focuses-strategy-after-period-of-low-visibility">Divest Dartmouth</a>. I spent the last year organizing with the mutual aid efforts of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/01/dartmouth-student-union-raises-over-50000-in-mutual-aid">Dartmouth Student Union</a> to help Dartmouth students through the economic hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

		<p>Iâ€™m currently in my last year at Dartmouth, trying to hit all the leftover items in my bucket list and (not) working on my honors thesis.</p>
