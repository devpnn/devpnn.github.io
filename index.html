			<p>Hi, I'm Dev.</p>
			
			<p>I'm a November 2022 graduate of <a target="_blank" href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>. I was a <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/king-scholars/">King Scholar</a> and studied Geography and Geospatial Statistics. I use my qualitative and quantitative skillset to explore my research interests in political eco(nomy/logy), global macroeconomic governance, climate change &amp; mitigation, and the linkages between the modern state, capital allocation, and the climate crisis.</p>

			<p>I have experience working with public opinion, governmental, epidemiological, and geospatial data. My most recent statistical research was using a multi-level model to estimate the effect that living in high-disaster-risk county has on how people of differing political orientations perceive personal climate risk. Before that, I worked on research detailing statistical biases common in analyses of COVID-19 data in US prisons and modified recent econometric approaches to apply to prison epidemiology, as well as helping develop an experimental game theory approach to determine population-level strategies for collective-action problems.</p>

			<p>Among visualization and mapping projects, I worked on series of animated data analytics communicating the public response to COVID-19, both as lifestyle choices and as emotional state. Other individual projects include an interactive, user-preference driven map of good places to eat in New Delhi, and an energy-systems map that calculates the annual carbon emissions of Chinese coal plants.</p>

			<p>In my qualitative work, my most recent research looked at climate policy briefs and philosophical accounts of time-perception to develop a roadmap for planetary climate action based on how people perceive risks in and of the future. My earlier qualitative projects have been a comparative literature analysis of internet "memes" as (meta-)linguistic texts, as well as a preliminary social theory of power in modern India. </p>

			<p>At Dartmouth, I have interned for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sustainability.dartmouth.edu/">Sustainability Office</a>, served on the advisory board of the <a target="_blank" href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/fysep/about/about-fysep">First-Generation Student Program (FYSEP)</a>, and been an elected executive of the <a target="_blank" href="https://engage.dartmouth.edu/organization/international-students-association">International Student Association</a>. I also successfully advocated for divesting the Dartmouth endowment from fossil fuel corporations with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2019/05/divest-dartmouth-re-focuses-strategy-after-period-of-low-visibility">Divest Dartmouth</a>, and spent my second half of college organizing with the mutual aid efforts of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/01/dartmouth-student-union-raises-over-50000-in-mutual-aid">Dartmouth Student Union</a> to help Dartmouth students through the economic hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p>Iâ€™m currently working on a few short-term projects after graduating, including GIS analytics for an education nonprofit and climate analytics/product strategy for a stealth sustainable fashion startup. In my free time, I'm working on independent research projects exploring the relationship between cognition, consciousness, and community as it pertains to generative AI models.</p>
